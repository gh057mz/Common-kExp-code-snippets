### Common-kExp-code-snippets

Welcome to this repository, a curated collection of code snippets and techniques for Windows kernel exploit development. This repository serves as a reference for various kernel exploitation methods I've found valuable in my work. While I've crafted somw of these examples, many snippets are sourced from other developers in the field; credits are provided wherever possible to honor the original authors.
